          Both interfaces are very similar in their interaction design, which
          probably stems from the fact that they both share the same creative
          intention: for users to play, experimentation and observe how
          different elements or variables interact with each other. This is
          clearly shown through the visual hierarchy of both interfaces. The
          sandbox environments which they want the users to focus on takes up
          most of the space: for Orb.Farm, the ecosystem tank, and Liquid
          Entropy the ‘metallic’ liquid. Both interfaces also have collapsible
          sidebar menus to maximize the screen space for the respective sandbox
          environment, which improves user experience. They both also lack
          proper instruction for their uses, which may have been intentional to
          incite curiosity and encourage full creativity. In Orb.Farm, each
          ecosystem element that can be added to the tank is represented as a
          text button, and users can simply drag or click on an area in the tank
          to add the elements. The buttons have the corresponding colours of
          their elements, making it easy for users to keep track of which
          elements are which, which is an example of good UI mapping. Liquid
          Entropy uses range sliders instead of buttons like Orb.Farm. This
          mapping choice may have been chosen due to the fact that the
          approximate value of the variable to be controlled matters more than
          an accurate one. Allowing users to freely control values through a
          range slider and not having to bother with precise values allows them
          to better focus on the visual feedback on the ‘liquid’ and adds to the
          user experience of the interface. After being on the site for a
          certain duration, there will be random surprise object that would
          appear at the foot of the elements menu that can be added to the
          ecosystem. This could be an engagement strategy aimed to retain the
          users’ interest should they start to become bored after being on the
          site for a long duration of time. Another useful feature of the site
          is the ‘info’ button on the the controls menu that provides
          information on all the elements, directs users to where they might
          report bugs as well as the credits for the graphics on the site. This
          feature adds to the accessibility and learnability of the interface,
          as I did leverage on the explanations of the elements to understand
          how the interactions work. In Liquid Entropy, when the users hovers
          over the page upon landing on it, there are instant interactive
          animations that appear as ‘ripples’ that follows the users cursor. The
          instant feedback makes the interface intuitive and allows users to
          efficiently interact with the site. It also implements audio design in
          its interface design, which Orb.Farm does not have. There are
          different forms of audio feedback for different interactions which
          provides another layer of interactivity that further enhances the user
          experience of the site. While both sites are largely similar in layout
          structure and information design, their characterisations are very
          different. Liquid Entropy has a more modern and minimalistic style to
          support the futuristic feeling of the metallic liquid, and Orb.Farm
          has a early Windows computer-inspired aesthetic, to complement the
          highly pixelated style of the ecosystem elements. While Liquid Entropy
          has a mysterious and dark feeling to it, Orb.Farm feels playfully
          inquisitive. Another key difference would be the interface’s state
          during user inactivity. For Liquid Entropy, there will be no movement
          if all interaction halts, but in Orb.Farm, the interactions between
          the elements will continue in the background even when the user in not
          on the site, and the background image of the interface will turn from
          day to night and back to day again, displaying the passage of time.
