          Both interfaces are very similar in their interaction design, which
          probably stems from the fact that they both share the same creative
          intention: for users to play, experimentation and observe how
          different elements or variables interact with each other.
          <br><br>
          This is clearly shown through the visual hierarchy of both interfaces.
          The sandbox environments which they want the users to focus on takes
          up most of the space: for Orb.Farm, the ecosystem tank, and Liquid
          Entropy the ‘metallic’ liquid. Both interfaces also have collapsible
          sidebar menus to maximize the screen space for the respective sandbox
          environment, which improves user experience. They both also lack user
          instructions, which may have been intentional to incite curiosity and
          encourage full creativity.

          While both sites are largely similar in layout structure and
          information design, their characterisation is very different. Liquid
          Entropy has a more modern and minimalistic style to support the
          futuristic feeling of the metallic liquid, and Orb.Farm has a early
          Windows computer-inspired aesthetic, to complement the highly
          pixelated style of the ecosystem elements. While Liquid Entropy has a
          mysterious and dark feeling to it, Orb.Farm feels playfully
          inquisitive.
          <br /><br />
          In Orb.Farm, each ecosystem element that can be added to the tank is
          represented as a text button, and users can simply drag or click on an
          area in the tank to add the elements. The buttons have the
          corresponding colours of their elements, making it easy for users to
          keep track of which elements are which, which is an example of good UI
          mapping. Liquid Entropy on the other hand, uses the same styling
          across all its controls which in comparison, has less usability and
          clarity.
          <br /><br />
          Liquid Entropy uses range sliders instead of buttons like Orb.Farm.
          This mapping choice may have been chosen due to the fact that the
          approximate value of the variable to be controlled matters more than
          an accurate one. Allowing users to freely control values through a
          range slider and not having to bother with precise values allows them
          to better focus on the visual feedback on the ‘liquid’ and adds to the
          user experience of the interface.

        <p style="text-align: left">
          In Liquid Entropy, when the users hovers over the page upon landing on
          it, there are instant interactive animations that appear as ‘ripples’
          that follows the users cursor. The instant feedback makes the
          interface intuitive and allows users to efficiently interact with the
          site. It also implements audio design in its interface design, which
          Orb.Farm does not have. There are different forms of audio feedback
          for different interactions which provides another layer of
          interactivity that further enhances the user experience of the site.
          <br /><br />
          Another key difference would be the interface’s state during user
          inactivity. For Liquid Entropy, there will be no movement if all
          interaction halts, but in Orb.Farm, the interactions between the
          elements will continue in the background even when the user in not on
          the site, and the background image of the interface will turn from day
          to night and back to day again, displaying the passage of time.
          <br /><br />
          A useful feature on Orb.Farm is the ‘info’ button on the the controls
          menu that provides information on all the elements, directs users to
          where they might report bugs as well as the credits for the graphics
          on the site. This feature adds to the accessibility and learnability
          of the interface, as I did leverage on the explanations of the
          elements to understand how the interactions work. Liquid Entropy
          however, does not have any kind of information directory at all.
